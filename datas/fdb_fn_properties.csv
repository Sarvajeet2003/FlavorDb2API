"ACACIA GUM","Acacia senegal (L ) Willd",Leguminosae,"Acacia [JAN]; Acacia senegal gum; Arabic gum; gum Arabic; Acacia delbata gum; Acacia solution; Acacia syrup; Australian gum; Gum Arabic; Indian gum; Wattle gum",9000-01-05,,2001,2001,,232-519-5,,414,"Arabic or acacia gum is the dried exudate obtained from the stems and branches of Acacia senegal (L ) Willd. or of related species of Acacia. Injured trees exude gum Arabic; heat, poor nutrition and drought stimulate its production. Most of the gum Arabic production is from wild trees, but some from privately owned and cultivated gardens are tapped and collected on a systematic basis The gum called Hashab geneina (garden gum) is the cleanest and lightest grade and is most preferred for the U S. market. The wild gum (called Hashab wady) is collected on a part-time basis in the dry season, from October to May or June, by natives whose main occupation is usually farming. After gathering, it is taken to central collecting stations where it is auctioned under government super-vision, graded by hand and dried before exporting to gum suppliers in all parts of the world. Then it is resorted, ground, processed and graded to various specifications Clear, white (sun-bleached) spheroidal tears, up to 32 mm in diameter, also occur as flakes. Chemically, gum Arabic is a neutral or slightly acid salt of a complex polysaccharide containing calcium, magnesium and potassium cations. Its most distinguishing prop-erty among the natural gums is its extreme solubility in water. Solutions of over 50% concentration may be prepared. Gum Arabic is best described as “heteropolymolecular,” that is, a polymer system having either a variation in monomer (galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid and 4-O-methylgucuronic acid) composition and/or variation in the mode of linking and branching of the monomer units, in addition to a distribution in molecular weight Major uses of gum Arabic in foods are as a fixative for flavors, a foam stabilizer in beverages, an adhesive for icings and toppings, and an emulsifier and stabilizer in confectionary and ice cream. It is also widely used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, paper, textile, paint, ink and lithography industries ","12,000,000.00 lb ","10.1694 mg/kg/day",,"21 CFR 169.179, 172.780, 184.1330, 582.7330; 27 CFR 24.246; 240.1051","Listed in Inactive Ingredient Guide (CDER, 1996); HOC (1992)","Not specified (1989)","2.47 mg",Natural,"(FCC, 1996); Appearance; White or yellowish white spheroidal ; tears; Heavy metals (as Pb); Not more than 0.002%; Arsenic (as As); Not more than 3 mg/kg; Identification; To 10 mL of a cold 1-in-50 solution of ; acacia, add 0.2 mL diluted lead ; subacetate TS; a flocculent, or curdy, ; white precipitate is formed ; immediately; Ash (acid-insoluble); Not more than 0.5%; Insoluble matter; Not more than 1%; Ash (total); Not more than 4%; Solubility","(FEMA, 1994)","[['Alcoholic beverages', '0.59', '1.53'], ['Imitation dairy', '9.56', '12.50'], ['Baked goods', '0.78', '3.84'], ['Instant coffee, tea', '0.13', '0.80'], ['Breakfast cereals', '0.07', '0.18'], ['Meat products', '0.99', '3.37'], ['Chewing gum', '27.83', '28.04'], ['Milk products', '0.04', '0.04'], ['Condiments, relishes', '0.09', '0.11'], ['Nonalcoholic beverages', '0.36', '0.66'], ['Confection, frosting', '12.72', '14.86'], ['Nut products', '6.38', '7.28'], ['Fats, oils', '4.34', '12.61'], ['Other grains', '10.00', '10.00'], ['Frozen dairy', '0.24', '0.32'], ['Snack foods', '5.72', '28.57'], ['Fruit juice', '0.36', '0.56'], ['Soft candy', '269.20', '452.10'], ['Fruit ices', '5.00', '9.99'], ['Soups', '0.04', '0.04'], ['Gelatins, puddings', '0.61', '5.28'], ['Sugar substitutes', '10.00', '10.00'], ['Hard candy', '276.50', '284.70']]",,"spicy sweet, fruity and honey with a woody, herbal nuance ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pure compound, glacial acetic acid, owes its name to its ice-like crystalline appearance at 15.6°C. As generally supplied, acetic acid is a 6 N aqueous solution (about 36%) or a 1 N solution (about 6%). These or other dilutions are used in adding appropriate amounts of acetic acid to foods. Acetic acid is the characteristic acid of vinegar, its concentration ranging from 3.5 to 5.6%. Acetic acid and acetates are present in most plants and animal tissues in small but detectable amounts. They are normal metabolic intermediates, are produced by such bacterial species as Acetobacter and can be synthesized completely from carbon dioxide by such microorganisms as Clostridium thermoaceticum. The rat forms acetate at the rate of 1% of its body weight per day As a colorless liquid with a strong, pungent, characteristic vinegar odor, it is useful in butter, cheese, grape and fruit flavors. Very little pure acetic acid as such is used in foods, although it is classified by FDA as a GRAS material. Consequently, it may be employed in products that are not covered by Definitions and Standards of Identity. Acetic acid is the principal component of vinegars and pyroligneous acid. In the form of vinegar, more than 27 million lb were added to food in 1986, with approximately equal amounts used as acidulants and flavoring agents. In fact, acetic acid (as vinegar) was one of the earliest flavoring agents. Vinegars are used extensively in preparing salad dressing and mayonnaise, sour and sweet pickles and numerous sauces and cat-sups. They are also used in the curing of meat and in the canning of certain vegetables. In the manufacture of mayonnaise, the addition of a portion of acetic acid (vinegar) to the salt- or sugar-yolk reduces the heat resistance of Salmonella.

It is manufactured synthetically in high yields by the oxidation of acetaldehyde and of butane, and as the reaction product of methanol and carbon monoxide Vinegars are produced from cider, grapes (or wine), sucrose, glucose or malt by successive alcoholic and acetous fermentations. In the United States, the use of the term “vinegar,” without qualifying adjectives, implies only cider vinegar. Although a 4 to 8% solution of pure acetic acid would have the same taste characteristics as cider vinegar, it could not qualify as a vinegar, since it would lack other readily detectable components characteristic of cider vinegar.

It is commercially available in bundles consisting of thin, mem-branous agglutinated strips or in cut, flaked granulated or powdered form. Although agar was discovered in Japan in 1658, it was introduced to Europe and the United States from China in the nineteenth century, where it was initially used as a gelatin substitute in the making of desserts. It soon became widely used as a solid bacteriological culture medium after its use by Robert Koch in his famous experiments. Its major uses in the food industry of today are in bakery products, confectionary, dairy products and canned meat and fish. It is also used in microbiology, dentistry and medicine The Gelidium species amansii and cartilageneum are the major sources of agar, although many species of Rhodophyceae are used. The weeds (agarophytes) used in the commercial product of agar grow from the tide line out to depths of 120 ft, and are harvested by waders along the shore at low tide, raked from small boats or picked by divers. Japan is the largest producer of agar. Because agar is soluble in hot water but relatively insoluble in cold water, it is extracted by boiling the agarophyte in water, filtering, cooling to form a gel, cutting into pieces and frozen, then thawing to free the agar from salts and other impuri-ties that are soluble in cold water. The wet agar is repeatedly washed with cold water and finally dried. American and Japanese agar are graded according to published specifications. The high-quality American agar is divided into bacteriological, medici-nal and dental grades, and the Japanese agar, into three grades and two subgrades.

The plant blooms from June to August. The parts of the angelica used are the roots, seeds and stems. The active principles of angelica are coumarin and furocoumarin. The plant (including roots and seeds) contains several furocoumarins including angelicin, bergapten and xanthotoxin, as well as umbelliprenin and various phenols. One of the main constituents is β-phellandrene Angelica may be cultivated as a fresh vegetable, or cooked and prepared like rhubarb. The dried roots and the corresponding derivatives find extensive use in the formulation of liqueurs. Roots are often employed in the flavoring of vermouths and bitters. The roots are sometimes employed with juniper berries to make gin. Angelica oil or extract contains 5-methoxypsoralen and 8-methoxypsoralen and, therefore, may evoke photodermatitis.

The part used is the kernel of the pit. Fruits vary in colors from yellows and oranges to deep purples. In India and China, the apricot has been used for over 2000 years. Excessive ingestion of apricot ker-nels causes cyanide poisoning in both animals and humans. Prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide) present in kernels has been used in Chinese medicine Constituents:Acids present in apricot fruits include malic, citric, tartaric, quinic, succinic, acetic, caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic. The cyanogenic glycoside amygdalin has been determined from the seeds. Sugars present in apricot include xylose, glucose, fructose and sorbitol.

It grows freely in waste places and hedgerows. The plant grows up to 3 m (9 ft), with large, ovate, wavy leaves and round heads of purple flowers. When mature, the leaves are alternate, triangular in outline, petiolate and dark green. The plant varies considerably in appearance, and various species and subspecies have been described in the literature according to the size of the flower heads and the whole plant, the abundance of the whitish cottonlike substance that is sometimes found on the involucres, or the absence of it, the length of flower stalks, etc. The whole plant is a dull pale-green, with stem branched, rising from a biennial root. The dried root from plants of the first year’s growth as well as the leaves and fruits (commonly, though erroneously, called seeds) are the parts used. Burdock root is consumed as a food in parts of Asia, including China and Japan. In Japan, production of burdock is estimated at 180,000 tons/year ",,,,,"HOC (1992)",,,,,,,,,,,,,"From seeds, both a tincture and a fluid extract are prepared.

The principal sources of cellulose for food-related purposes are cotton linters and wood pulp Chemical processing converts cellulose into forms or derivatives suitable for incorporation into food products or for use in food packaging materials. For food use, the optimum degree of substitution of a carboxymethyl-residue on each anhydroglucopyranose unit on cellulose is 0.95. By preliminary mild acid hydrolysis, the degree of polymerization (i e , molecular size) of the cellulose may be reduced before carboxymethylation. Control of the degree of substitution and the degree of polymerization during process-ing results in production of a wide variety of derivatives that differ in such physical properties as gelling, temperature, viscosity and dispersibility in water.

In the United States, cloves have been used since colonial times. The principal use of cloves is in flavoring of foods and tobacco; minor uses of cloves are as analgesics and germicides The quality of the clove product is dependent on the development stage of the flower bud. Clove buds are typically dark brown with four calyx lobes. Buds and stems are harvested by hand, sun-dried and marketed. The highest quality buds are sold as whole cloves, whereas lower quality buds, stems and leaves are used in the production of essential oils. The aroma is strongly aromatic and spicy. The flavor is warm.

The stem is round, smooth, green, often with a tinge of red, about 30 cm (1 ft) high, regularly divided at the top into three petioles, with a flower-stalk in the center. The petiole is round, smooth and swollen at the base; leaves 3 to 7, ternate, quinate, or septentate that drop in the fall. Flowers are small, greenish, in a simple umbel, supported by a round, slender peduncle, which rises from the top of the stem in the center of the petioles. The plant bears a cluster of red or yellowish fruits from June to July.

Native to North America, Japan, Taiwan, China and the Himalayas, the species has horizontal branches, solitary monoecious flowers and globose to ovoid or oblong cones with thin, persistent scales. The bark of T. canadensis is a valuable source of tannin. T. heterophylla is the largest North American species, being 70 m (230 ft) or more in height. Spruce:P. glauca is a tall tree (15 to 45 m, or 49 to 148 ft tall) resembling the balsam fir (Abies balsamea). White spruce has slender, pale, glaucous leaves and cylindrical cones with thin scales. P. canadensis is a shorter tree of 8 to 12 m (26 to 39 ft). It has short, thick, pale bluish-green leaves and short, ovoid or subglobose cones persisting for several years. Distillation of needles and twigs of the above plants yields hemlock and spruce oils. No attempt is made to keep these species separate for oil production; hence, spruce oil and hemlock oil are used interchangeably in commercial practice.

It is usually harvested from April to September by hand-raking from small boats at ebb tide. Cast weed is also collected on the shore. The weed is dried and bailed before shipping to processors. The dried weed is first washed in cold water to remove soluble impurities. It may then be ion exchanged if monovalent salts are desired. Extraction of carrageenan from the weed is carried out with hot water. The crude extract, containing about 1% solids, is treated with adsorbents to remove soluble impurities, then filtered, vacuum-concentrated to 2 to 3% solids and drum-dried or alcohol-precipitated.

"IRISH MOSS EXTRACT (CARRAGEENAN)",,,"Carrageen extract; Chondrus extract",9000-07-01,,2596,2596,,232-524-2,,,"Carrageenan is a generic term used for chemically similar hydrocolloids obtained by aqueous extraction from certain members of the class Rhodophyceae. Carrageenan is a strongly charged anionic polyelectrolyte of large size. It is generally regarded as containing two major fractions, which may be separated from dilute aqueous solution by the precipitation of one fraction by the addition of potassium ions. The precipitated fraction, or gelling fraction, is designated k-carragenan, and is composed of residues of D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-D-galactose in a molar ratio of 1.1 to 1.5:1 and contains one sulfate half-ester group for every 2 to 2.5 monosaccharide units, depending on the source. l-Carrageenan, the nongelling fraction, is composed primarily of 1,3-linked D-galactose-2-sulfate and 1,4-linked D-galactose-2,6-disulfate. The sulfate content of the two fractions differs substantially, with values of approximately 24 and 33% having been given for the k and l fractions, respectively. Carrageenan is readily soluble in water, but it has few other solvents. In the presence of specific metallic cations, such as potassium, calcium, ammonium and others, car-rageenan solutions form short, inelastic, thermally reversible gels on heating and cooling. The most unique property of carrageenan as a hydrocolloid is its high degree of reactivity with certain proteins; its reactivity with milk protein, in particular, is the basis for a number of applications of carrageenan in foods.

It has alternate leaves and dioecious flowers. Only female trees bear nuts; male plants are interdispersed in the groves only to ensure pollination. The ripe fruits are yellow-red with a fleshy pericarp; the red arillode is tightly wrapped around a woody hull containing the seed. The nut is removed and dried to produce nutmeg. The dried aril yields the spice mace, which possesses a flavor similar to that of nutmeg. Thus mace designates the dried arillodes of nutmeg. The ratio of nutmeg to mace is approximately 10:1. Nutmeg and mace yield different, but sometimes similar, products. The parts used are the nuts (free of the outer pulp) and arillodes (decolorized with lime) The most commercially important qualities of nutmeg and mace are as follows:Banda nutmeg and Banda mace contain 8 and 13% essential oil, respectively; Java nutmeg and Java mace contain 6.5 and 11% essential oil, respectively; Siauw nutmeg and Siauw mace contain 6.5% and 10 to 12% essential oil, respectively.

Other related lichen—E. furfuracea and Usnea barbata—that grow on spruces and firs are known by the more generic name of “tree moss ” Oak moss derivatives are light green and exhibit a rich odor, while tree moss derivatives have a grayish-green color and a slight resinous odor. E. prunastri yields the most valuable extraction products, while other tree mosses yield products of inferior quality. Oak moss is harvested mainly in France, the former Yugoslavia, Italy, Morocco and Hungary. The harvested moss is pressed into bails and shipped to the extractive sites. The part used is the lichen. Oak moss has a delicate, pleasant, green, moss-like odor ",,,"See Oak Moss Absolute","See Oak Moss Absolute","HOC (1992)",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The concrete is prepared by benzene or petroleum ether extraction in approximately 2 to 4% and 1.5 to 3.0% yields, respectively. It is a dark-green, waxy mass with a delicate, green, moss-like odor. Usually, the moss is immersed in water for about 6 hours, dried and finally extracted to improve yields. Absolute:The absolute is obtained by alcoholic extraction of the concrete. Extraction lasts approximately 5 hours, yielding a dark-green liquid in approximately 60% yields. The alcoholic solution is chilled to 6°C to separate the insoluble waxes. Sometimes the absolutes are decolorized using activated carbon and the liquid product is vacuum-distilled. Absolute Codistillates:In order to obtain a good yield of essential oil and to improve the color of the distillate, the absolute is codis-tilled under vacuum together with a high-boiling, odorless solvent, thereby yielding the so-called absolute codistillates. The codistil-lates offer a better solubility; they are virtually colorless and retain the characteristic oak moss odor. Resinoid:The so-called oak moss resinoid is in fact the hot alcohol extract from the lichen. The resinoid is a black-green or brownish-green liquid. This product is not used in flavors because it contains ethyl everninate formed by esterification of the evernic acid, naturally occurring in oak moss. The ethyl ester is, in fact, toxic. Essential oil:Obtained by steam distillation of the lichen; however, this product is of little com-mercial importance because of the very low yields (0.07%). Usually oak moss concrete and oak moss absolute are steam-distilled, preferably under reduced pressure ",,,"Mousse de Chêne (Fr ), Eichenmoos (Ger ), Musco de encina (Sp ), Muschio di quercia (It ) ","Main constituents of the ether-extracted concrete include evernicacid, orcinol, phenols, acids (formic, acetic, stearic, palmitic and oleic), α- and β-thujone, camphor, borneol, cineol, naphthalene, ketones, terpene alcohols and traces of vanillin ",,,,,

The Mediterranean countries in which it is cultivated include Italy (Sicily, Calabria and Campania), Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Spain and Israel; in addition, very important production occurs in California and Florida. It has enormous worldwide economic importance. In the various countries, cultivation is geared toward the production of (1) fruits for immediate consumption and (2) fruits to be used for the production of juices or essential oils. For this purpose, the most suitable varieties have been selected. The parts used are the leaves (and small twigs); flowers; ripe fruits; small, whole, unripe fruits, peels and juice. The oils and various derivatives from orange sweet have a mild-to-highly bitter, astringent flavor and a characteristic aroma. The juices are sweet and acidic or tart Pulp juice is generally pasteurized and concentrated. Sulfur dioxide and other preservatives may be added depending on local laws. It can be distinguished commercially as turbid juice (pasteurized) or clear juice (nonpasteurized). Pasteurization serves to inactivate pectolytic enzymes in the juice that would tend to clarify the product on standing. Both types may contain pulp in varying amounts (large, medium or fine cells).

The flowering tops are the only part used. Origanum has a fresh, herbaceous odor and a warm, burning flavor. The oil is obtained by steam distillation from the dried, flowering herb of various origanum species with yields of less than 1% Confusion abounds regarding the identities of the sources of marjoram, origanum and thyme. A number of genera and species associated with these plants are identified. Details of species considered commercially important are summarized by Burdock (1997). A number of botanical sources are classified under the name “origans ” These species differ considerably in both odor and flavor characteristics. The so-called “wild marjoram” is the common herb Origanum vulgare, which is cultivated all over the world. The commercially known “oil of wild marjoram” is distilled from the plant Thymus martichina, which grows wild in the mountainous areas of central Spain. The latter, in turn, should not be confused with “Spanish origanum” (Thymus capitatus), which yields an essential oil with a high (about 50%) carvacrol content.

The best-known commercial qualities of pepper include Malabar and Lampong. Whole, dried berries, consisting of the epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp, yield black pepper. Berries stripped of the epicarp and the outer portion of the mesocarp (by manual or mechanical maceration) yield white pepper The dried berry contains the aroma distributed as follows:the epicarp contains the resinous fraction consisting of chavicin and the outer portion of the mesocarp contains the essential oil. Therefore, black pepper yields an essential oil and oleoresin, while white pepper is used only as a spice. Black pepper retains both the odor and flavor characteristics of pepper, while white pepper retains only the sharp, piquant flavor due to piperine. The part used are the berries, which are harvested at the onset of ripeneng.

Generally, pines are more adaptable to Southern climate conditions than spruces and firs. True pine oil consists of approximately 2% of the total distillable and extractable material from pine heartwood and stumpwood. The steam-distilled wood yields oil that is steam-distilled or fractionally distilled under vacuum. The lower boiling fractions yield the so-called wood turpentine. The steam-distilled chips are exhausted by extraction with a hydrocarbon solvent. The solvent is evapo-rated and the extract subjected to fractional distillation under reduced pressure. Again, the lighter fractions consist of turpentine, while the resinous residue consists of rosin. White or yellow pine oils are obtained after rectification.

X. americanum is an indig-enous shrub, 10 or 12 ft in height, with alternate branches, which are armed with strong, conical, brown prickles and broad base, scattered irregularly, though most frequently in pairs at the insertion of the young branches. The leaves are alternate and pinnate; the leaflets about five pairs, with an odd one, nearly sessile, ovate, acute, with slight vesicular serratures and somewhat downy under-neath; the common petiole is round, usually prickly on the back. The flowers are borne in small, dense, sessile umbels near the origin of the young branches; they are small, greenish, dioecious or polygamous, and appear before the leaves. The aromatic, pungent bark is used in the southern United States as a rustic remedy for toothaches. The parts used are bark and berries.

Its radical leaves split when the plant is 2 years old. R. palmatum grows in Tibet and western China, especially in high-altitude areas with dry climate. R. officinale differs from R. palmatum in that the leaves are divided in large, indented lobes; the bark is not red-dotted as that of R. palmatum, and the inflorescence is enlarged at the top. The plant flowers after 3 years and forms a flower-bearing stalk up to 2 to 3 m (7 to 10 ft) in height, with a long ear consisting of small, white-yellowish flowers (May to June). It grows in the high-altitude areas of Tibet and China. R. rhaponticum is a perennial, herbaceous plant growing up to 1 to 2 m (3 to 7 ft) in height. It has a thick rhizome, erect stalk, numerous leaves and white-yellowish flowers in a terminal cluster. It is native to central Asia and extensively cultivated in Europe. The parts used are the skinned rhizomes and roots of R. rhaponticum. The dried product has various appearances, depending on the origin of the plant. Chinese rhubarb is classified by shape—flat, derived from large, cylindrical rhizomes split in the middle, or round. The rhizome is heavy, hard, orange-yellow or reddish gray, exhibiting irregular, granular fractures. The characteristic star-shaped nodules, not present in the roots, are apparent. The Chinese rhubarb rhizome exhibits a radius larger than that of R. rhaponticum. The two varieties may also be differentiated by the harsher odor of R. rhaponticurn as compared to Chinese rhubarb. Under Wood’s fluorescent light, the reddish-brown color of Chinese rhubarb remains unaltered, whereas that of R. rhaponticum changes from violet to blue on addi-tion of ammonia.

Countries where rose is extensively cultivated for extractive purposes include Bulgaria, Turkey, Morocco, France and Italy. The parts used are the flowers, buds, leaves and fruit (hips). Rose has a deep, warm, rich rose odor with a slightly bitter, sharp flavor at high concentrations; pleasant on dilution. The fragrance of the rose flower, captured by extraction, is one of the most valuable flavor and fragrance products used. The most common aroma concentrates of rose are rose oil and rose water, derived from steam distillation; and rose concrete and rose absolute from solvent extraction. Of these, rose oil and rose concrete are produced in the largest quantities The choice of rose derivatives for flavor application is often determined by the feasibility of introducing water-soluble β-phenethyl alcohol into the flavor complex.

VANILLA,"Vanilla planifolia Jacks ; V. tahitensis J. W. Moore; V. pompona Schiede",Orchidaceae,,,,3104,3104,474,,,,"A great variety of vanilla plants bearing the vanilla pods, or siliques, exist. Those mentioned above are the most impor-tant species. Of special value are those cultivated in Mexico, Madagascar, Java, Tahiti, the Comoro Islands and Réunion. The cultiva-tion of vanilla beans is very long and laborious. The plant is a perennial herbaceous vine that grows up to 25 m in height and needs suitable supports in order to grow. Fecundation of flowers is performed (November to December) by perforating the membrane that separates the pollen from the pistil. This is an exacting task requiring skilled hand labor. Natural fecundation occurs when a similar operation is carried out by birds or insects that perforate the membrane in search of food. After a few months, clusters of hanging pods (siliques) are formed; these start to yellow at the lower tip from August to September. At this point, the siliques are harvested and undergo special treatment that develops the aroma. The siliques are placed in straw baskets and dipped into hot water to rupture the inner cell wall. After a few months, the aroma starts developing. Then the siliques are exuded by intermittent exposure to sunlight (by alternately covering and uncovering the siliques with wool blankets). When exudation is complete, the siliques are oiled with cocoa oil to avoid chapping during drying and are finally dried to a suitable residual moisture content. In the final stage of the preparation, the best quality siliques form a vanilla “brine” that crystallizes on the surface of the bean. Generally, the processing of vanilla bean takes more than a year. The most important commercial qualities are brined vanilla, bastard vanilla and vanilla pompona. The bean is the only part used.

The Extra fraction exhibits the highest specific gravity and ester number, and the lowest optical rotation and refractive index, whereas the third fraction has the low-est specific gravity and ester number and the highest optical rotation and refractive index. Thus, the quality of the various fractions can be simply determined from their physicochemical properties.
